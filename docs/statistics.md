Useful for further processing, reporting, or audits.

## ↔️ Diff table

The diff view splits data around a reference upload date.

For example, setting `Diff from`: *2025-01-01* highlights what’s been uploaded since then—helpful for tracking changes over time.
No data is displayed until a reference date is selected.
