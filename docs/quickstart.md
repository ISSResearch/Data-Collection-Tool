# ðŸš€ Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up and using ISS Data Collection Tool locally.

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISSResearch/Data-Collection-Tool.git
cd data-collection-tool
```

## 2. Build images

```bash
make build
```

## 3. Start in Prod Mode

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
make start
```

Make sure make, Docker, and Docker Compose are installed.
Edit the .env file to suit your environment before proceeding.

This command starts all services in production mode using Docker Compose.
The project will be accessible at http://localhost:8000 (default port).

## 4. Create admin user
```bash
make init-admin
```

You must create a superuser before accessing the UI.
Only admin users can currently create new projects and manage roles/permissions.
More about that in [Users and Roles](/docs/users.md)
